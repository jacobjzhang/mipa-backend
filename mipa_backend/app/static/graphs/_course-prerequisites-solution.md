It's clear from the original question that we're trying to detect a cycle. This sounds like a problem that DFS (depth-first search) can solve.

Since this a directed graph, we can use a topological sort algorithm, essentially sorting based on previous prerequisites.

The pair form `[course, prerequisite]` can be used to build the graph. Each time we encounter a pair, we're essentially adding a directed edge from vertex prerequisite to vertex course.

Here's the initial method with comments on what's happening:

```js
function allCoursesPossible(numCourses, prerequisites) {
  // initialize an array of visits, and a boolean
  // flag that we'll return as the answer
  let visited = new Array(numCourses),
      possibleToComplete = true;
  
  visited.fill(false);       // no visits yet

  // initialize hashmap/adjacency list of coursePreReqs
  // with each index representing the course number
  let coursePreReqs = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
    coursePreReqs[i] = [];
  };
  
  // the key is the course, and we represent its
  // prerequisites as a value in its array
  for (let requirement of prerequisites) {
    coursePreReqs[requirement[0]].push(requirement[1]);
  };
  
  // loop through each of the courses and run dfs on it
  for (let course in coursePreReqs) {
    if (possibleToComplete && !visited[course]) {
        visited[course] = true;   // mark this course as visited

        let onThePath = new Array(numCourses);
        onThePath.fill(false);

        dfs(course, onThePath);
    }
  }
  
  return possibleToComplete;
};
```  
Now onto the actual depth-first search method. Note that we keep a separate array called `onThePath` to track `dfs` visits solely for this iteration.

```js
function dfs(courseIdx, onThePath) {
  // if we find out earlier it's impossible to complete, skip
  if (!possibleToComplete) return;
  
  visited[courseIdx] = true;

  // we've detected a cycle
  if (onThePath[courseIdx]) {
      possibleToComplete = false;
      return;
  }
  
  // recursively visit each of its prereqs
  // recall that `pre` in this case is the course
  // index representing the prerequisite, so we keep
  // going back until there's no more prereqs
  for (let pre in coursePreReqs[courseIdx]) {
      onThePath[courseIdx] = true;
      dfs(coursePreReqs[courseIdx][pre], onThePath);
      onThePath[courseIdx] = false;
  }
};
```

If we piece it all together:

```js
class CourseSchedule {
  allCoursesPossible(numCourses, prerequisites) {
    this.visited = new Array(numCourses),
    this.possibleToComplete = true;
    
    this.visited.fill(false);

    this.coursePreReqs = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
      this.coursePreReqs[i] = [];
    };
    
    for (let requirement of prerequisites) {
      this.coursePreReqs[requirement[0]].push(requirement[1]);
    };
    
    for (let course in this.coursePreReqs) {
      if (this.possibleToComplete && !this.visited[course]) {
          this.visited[course] = true;

          let onThePath = new Array(numCourses);
          onThePath.fill(false);

          this.dfs(course, onThePath);
      }
    }
    
    return this.possibleToComplete;
  };

  dfs(courseIdx, onThePath) {
    if (!this.possibleToComplete) return;
    
    this.visited[courseIdx] = true;

    if (onThePath[courseIdx]) {
        this.possibleToComplete = false;
        return;
    }

    for (let pre in this.coursePreReqs[courseIdx]) {
        onThePath[courseIdx] = true;
        this.dfs(this.coursePreReqs[courseIdx][pre], onThePath);
        onThePath[courseIdx] = false;
    }
  };
}
```

In the following example, what will happen is it'll build the `coursePreReqs` hash, and then start with course 0.

Using DFS, we'll find that course 0's traversal goes:

0 --> 2 --> 1 --> 0

```js
let n = 3;
let preReqs = [[1, 0], [2, 1], [0, 2]];

const cs = new CourseSchedule;
cs.allCoursesPossible(n, preReqs);
// false
```

The time complexity is O(V+E) because we lean on depth-first search (not taking into account the adjacency list), and space complexity is O(V).
