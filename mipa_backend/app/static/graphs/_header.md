<!-- It's Sunday-- time to move on to our next topic! -->

Graphs are the focus this week -- certainly one of the most relevant data structures to web development, this non-linear abstraction allows for the modeling of many real-life concepts.  If this is your first time dabbling with graphs, we highly recommend you start with the *Resources to get you started* section at the bottom of this email.

<h4 style="text-align: center;font-weight:600;">Where are graphs used today?</h4>

* **Facebook** - The social network giant's entire business is built on its social graph. Users are vertices and relationships are edges, and graph theory concepts like traversals are used to determine recommended friends.

* **Google Maps and Uber** - Both built mapping technology based on the idea of transportation networks modeled as a graph. Many algorithms, such as Bellman Ford's shortest path, are used to identify the quickest routes to somewhere.

* **Photoshop** - The paint bucket fill tool is a version of the `flood fill algorithm`, which looks for nodes in a graph representation of pixels of similar color via traversal.
