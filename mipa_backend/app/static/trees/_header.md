<h4 style="text-align: center;font-weight:600;">Good morning!</h4>

You've been knocking it out of the ballpark with string manipulation questions. This week's focus will be around all things trees. If you're not sure how to approach this problem, we highly recommend you start with the *Resources to get you started* section at the bottom of this email.

Additionally, reminder that the definition of our tree nodes look like this:

```js
function Node(val) {
  this.val = val;
  this.left = null;
  this.right = null;
}
```

As always, have fun and take it slow. Let's get started!
