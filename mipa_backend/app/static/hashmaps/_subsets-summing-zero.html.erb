<p>Given an array of positive and negative integers, can you return the starting and ending indexes of all subarrays in it that sum up to zero?</p>

<pre>
let arr = [3, 5, -2, -4, 7, -1, 4, 7, -4, 4]
findSumZeroSubsets(arr)
=> From 2 to 5    // (-2, -4, 7, -1)
=> From 8 to 9    // (-4, 4)

let arr = [4, -5, 1, -3, 2, -8, 5, -2, -3, 9]
findSumZeroSubsets(arr)
=> From 0 to 2
=> From 2 to 4
=> From 6 to 8
=> From 0 to 9
=> From 3 to 9
</pre>

<p>Hint: Look at array [1, 2, 0, 2, -2] and see the aggregating sums from index 0 up to index 3, and then index 5.</p>
